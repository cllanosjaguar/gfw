# What is Global Forest Watch?

[Global Forest Watch](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) (GFW) is a
dynamic online forest monitoring and alert system that empowers people
everywhere to better manage forests. This repository contains the GFW web app.

# Developing

The GFW web app rides on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Installing the app

We recommend managing your Ruby installation through
[rvm](https://github.com/rvm/rvm). It's just an easy way to
run multiple Ruby versions for different applications:

```bash
$ \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
```

Next clone the gfw repo:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw.git
```

Using rbenv, install and set Ruby 2.4.0 in the main app directory:

```bash
$ cd gfw
$ rvm install 2.4.0
$ rvm use 2.4.0
```

Now let's install Ruby on Rails:

```bash
$ gem install rails
```

Aaaaand now use [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), a rubygem manager, to
install all the gem dependencies for the app:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Installing front end dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Almost there! Final steps are to copy the `.env.sample` to `.env`, and start the server:

```bash
$ yarn start
```
The app should now be accessible on [http://0.0.0.0:5000](http://0.0.0.0:5000).

## Deployment

We follow a [Gitflow Worklow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) for development and deployment. Our `master` branch goes to production, `develop` goes to `master`. We also have a staging branch which is detached from the workflow that can be used to merge multiple branches for deployment to the staging site. Additionally you can deploy `develop` or feature branches to staging if desired.

## Releases

We are using github releases to record changes to the app. To help us manage this we are using [Zeit Releases](https://github.com/zeit/release), an npm package for handling github releases, tagging commits (major, minor, patch), and automating semantic release logs. For a more detailed explanation of semantic changelogs see [this post](https://semver.org/).

#### Managing commits for a release

When developing, you can tag your commits as follows: `fix some excellent bug (patch)` where `patch` can be `(major/minor/patch/ignore)`. This commit title will automatically be grouped into the correct section for the release. Otherwise you will be prompted during the release to assign (or ignore) each of your commits. You will have to do this for every commit so don't forget to squash!

So how do you make a release on GFW?

1. Checkout master and merge in develop (not compulsory but advised for consistency).
2. Run `npx release [type]` where type can be `major`, `minor`, `patch`, or `pre` (see [zeit docs](https://github.com/zeit/release) for more details).
3. Follow the prompts to manage commits.
4. You will be taken to github draft release editor with all your commits grouped and ready to go.
5. Enter your title and include any extra info you want.
6. Publish!

## Layers

Map layers, somewhat unsurprisingly, are an important part of GFW. As
such, the config and code supporting them can be a bit complex. Check
out the [layer documentation](docs/layers) for more information. If the
component you're working on isn't in there, please write some
documentation when you're done! ðŸ’ž

## Google Custom Search API

Global Forest Watch uses the Google Custom Search API to power it's site-wide
search.

The search requests are handled inside: `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`
And depend on two config variables that you'll need to setup as ENV vars on
your `.env` file locally or in the Heroku environment settings.

```
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY
GOOGLE_CUSTOM_SEARCH_CX
```

Currently the API being used was generated by `simao.belchior@vizzuality.com`
and the custom search context is owned by Alyssa Barrett on the Google Custom
Search Engine control panel.


## Testing

We are using `RSpec` for backend view and Rails testing. [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/Vizzuality/gfw) handles our continuous integration for running tests. This calls both our backend and front end tests using `npm run ci`.

### Development

We have tried to make developing tests for GFW as simple as possible. If you are working with an older part of the site like `my-gfw` then you might need to write tests inside the `spec/` folder. To run these you can execute `rspec`.

### BrowserStack

We use [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to find and fix cross-browser issues.

# RW API Documentation for GFW

Map layers and relevent datasets are stored in the [RW-API](http://api.resourcewatch.org/) and the `globalforestwatch.org/map` utilises the [layer-manager](https://github.com/Vizzuality/layer-manager) to render them.

The schema used to style these layers, their legends, and define their interactions are specific to the *Global Forest Watch* platform.

When creating or modifying layers/datasets for GFW, follow the schema and syntax outlined in the [API Documentation](./docs/API_Documentation.md) markdown file.

To view GFW-specific layers and datasets use the following endpoint:

https://api.resourcewatch.org/v1/dataset?app=gfw&includes=layer,vocabulary,metadata&page[size]=200
